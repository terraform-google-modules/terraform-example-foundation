## Purpose

The purpose of this step is to bootstrap a Google Cloud organization, creating all the required resources and permissions to start using the Cloud Foundation Toolkit (CFT). This step also configures a [CI/CD Pipeline](/docs/GLOSSARY.md#foundation-cicd-pipeline) for foundations code in subsequent stages. The [CI/CD Pipeline](/docs/GLOSSARY.md#foundation-cicd-pipeline) can use either Cloud Build and Cloud Source Repos or Jenkins and your own Git repos (which might live on-premises).

## Intended usage and support

This repository is intended as an example to be forked, tweaked, and maintained in the user's own version-control system; the modules within this repository are not intended for use as remote references.
Though this blueprint can help accelerate your foundation design and build, we assume that you have the engineering skills and teams to deploy and customize your own foundation based on your own requirements.

We will support:

- Code is semantically valid, pinned to known good versions, and passes terraform validate and lint checks
- All PR to this repo must pass integration tests to deploy all resources into a test environment before being merged
- Feature requests about ease of use of the code, or feature requests that generally apply to all users, are welcome

We will not support:

- In-place upgrades from a foundation deployed with an earlier version to a more recent version, even for minor version changes, might not be feasible. Repository maintainers do not have visibility to what resources a user deploys on top of their foundation or how the foundation was customized in deployment, so we make no guarantee about avoiding breaking changes.
- Feature requests that are specific to a single user's requirement and not representative of general best practices

## Prerequisites

To run the commands described in this document, install the following:

- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) version 393.0.0 or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) version 2.28.0 or later
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) version 1.5.7
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) version 1.6.0 or later

**Note:** Make sure that you use the same version of [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) throughout this series. Otherwise, you might experience Terraform state snapshot lock errors.

Version 1.5.7 is the last version before the license model change. To use a later version of Terraform, ensure that the Terraform version used in the Operational System to manually execute part of the steps in `3-networks` and `4-projects` is the same version configured in the following code

- 0-bootstrap/modules/jenkins-agent/variables.tf

   ```
   default     = "1.5.7"
   ```

- 0-bootstrap/cb.tf

   ```
   terraform_version = "1.5.7"
   ```

- scripts/validate-requirements.sh

   ```
   TF_VERSION="1.5.7"
   ```

- build/github-tf-apply.yaml

   ```
   terraform_version: '1.5.7'
   ```

- github-tf-pull-request.yaml

   ```
   terraform_version: "1.5.7"
   ```

- 0-bootstrap/Dockerfile

   ```
   ARG TERRAFORM_VERSION=1.5.7
   ```

Also make sure that you've done the following:

1. Set up a Google Cloud
   [organization](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization).
1. Set up a Google Cloud
   [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account).
1. Create Cloud Identity or Google Workspace groups as defined in [groups for access control](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations/authentication-authorization#groups_for_access_control).
Set the variables in **terraform.tfvars** (`groups` block) to use the specific group names you create.
1. For the user who will run the procedures in this document, grant the following roles:
   - The `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` role on the Google Cloud organization.
   - The `roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin` role on the Google Cloud organization.
   - The `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator` role on the Google Cloud organization.
   - The `roles/billing.admin` role on the billing account.
   - The `roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator` role.
   - The `roles/securitycenter.admin` role.

     ```bash
     # example:
     gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding ${ORG_ID}  --member=user:$SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL --role=roles/securitycenter.admin --quiet > /dev/null 1>&1
     ```

1. Enable the following additional services on your current bootstrap project:

     ```bash
     gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
     gcloud services enable cloudbilling.googleapis.com
     gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
     gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com
     gcloud services enable servicenetworking.googleapis.com
     ```

### Optional - Automatic creation of Google Cloud Identity groups

In the foundation, Google Cloud Identity groups are used for [authentication and access management](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations/authentication-authorization) .

To enable automatic creation of the [groups](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations/authentication-authorization#groups_for_access_control), complete the following actions:

- Have an existing project for Cloud Identity API billing.
- Enable the Cloud Identity API (`cloudidentity.googleapis.com`) on the billing project.
- Grant role `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` to the user running Terraform on the billing project.
- Change the field `groups.create_required_groups` to **true** to create the required groups.
- Change the field `groups.create_optional_groups` to **true** and fill the `groups.optional_groups` with the emails to be created.

### Optional - Cloud Build access to on-prem

See [onprem](./onprem.md) for instructions on how to configure Cloud Build access to your on-premises environment.

### Troubleshooting

See [troubleshooting](../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if you run into issues during this step.

## Deploying with Jenkins

*Warning: the guidance for deploying with Jenkins is no longer actively tested or maintained. While we have left the guidance available for users who prefer Jenkins, we make no guarantees about its quality, and you might be responsible for troubleshooting and modifying the directions.*

If you are using the `jenkins_bootstrap` sub-module, see [README-Jenkins](./README-Jenkins.md)
for requirements and instructions on how to run the 0-bootstrap step. Using
Jenkins requires a few manual steps, including configuring connectivity with
your current Jenkins manager (controller) environment.

## Deploying with GitHub Actions

If you are deploying using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), see [README-GitHub.md](./README-GitHub.md)
for requirements and instructions on how to run the 0-bootstrap step.
Using GitHub Actions requires manual creation of the GitHub repositories used in each stage.

## Deploying with GitLab Pipelines

If you are deploying using [GitLab Pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/), see [README-GitLab.md](./README-GitLab.md)
for requirements and instructions on how to run the 0-bootstrap step.
Using GitLab Pipeline requires manual creation of the GitLab projects (repositories) used in each stage.

## Deploying with Terraform Cloud

If you are deploying using [Terraform Cloud](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs), see [README-Terraform-Cloud.md](./README-Terraform-Cloud.md)
for requirements and instructions on how to run the 0-bootstrap step.
Using Terraform Cloud requires manual creation of the GitHub repositories or GitLab projects used in each stage.

## Deploying with Cloud Build

*Warning: This method has a dependency on Cloud Source Repositories, which is [no longer available to new customers](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/docs). If you have previously used the CSR API in your organization then you can use this method, but a newly created organization will not be able to enable CSR and cannot use this deployment method. In that case, we recommend that you follow the directions for deploying locally, Github, Gitlab, or Terraform Cloud instead.*

The following steps introduce the steps to deploy with Cloud Build Alternatively, use the [helper script](../helpers/foundation-deployer/README.md) to automate all the stages of. Use the helper script when you want to rapidly create and destroy the entire organization for demonstration or testing purposes, without much customization at each stage.

1. Clone [terraform-example-foundation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation) into your local environment and navigate to the `0-bootstrap` folder.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation.git

   cd terraform-example-foundation/0-bootstrap
   ```

1. Rename `terraform.example.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars` and update the file with values from your environment:

   ```bash
   mv terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars
   ```

1. Use the helper script [validate-requirements.sh](../scripts/validate-requirements.sh) to validate your environment:

   ```bash
   ../scripts/validate-requirements.sh -o <ORGANIZATION_ID> -b <BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID> -u <END_USER_EMAIL>
   ```

   **Note:** The script is not able to validate if the user is in a Cloud Identity or Google Workspace group with the required roles.

1. Run `terraform init` and `terraform plan` and review the output.

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan -input=false -out bootstrap.tfplan
   ```

1. To  validate your policies, run `gcloud beta terraform vet`. For installation instructions, see [Install Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation/validate-policies#install).

1. Run the following commands and check for violations:

   ```bash
   export VET_PROJECT_ID=A-VALID-PROJECT-ID
   terraform show -json bootstrap.tfplan > bootstrap.json
   gcloud beta terraform vet bootstrap.json --policy-library="../policy-library" --project ${VET_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   *`A-VALID-PROJECT-ID`* must be an existing project you have access to. This is necessary because `gcloud beta terraform vet` needs to link resources to a valid Google Cloud Platform project.

1. Run `terraform apply`.

   ```bash
   terraform apply bootstrap.tfplan
   ```

1. Run `terraform output` to get the email address of the terraform service accounts that will be used to run manual steps for `shared` environments in steps `3-networks-dual-svpc`, `3-networks-hub-and-spoke`, and `4-projects` and the state bucket that will be used by step 4-projects.

   ```bash
   export network_step_sa=$(terraform output -raw networks_step_terraform_service_account_email)
   export projects_step_sa=$(terraform output -raw projects_step_terraform_service_account_email)
   export projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate=$(terraform output -raw projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate)

   echo "network step service account = ${network_step_sa}"
   echo "projects step service account = ${projects_step_sa}"
   echo "projects gcs bucket tfstate = ${projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate}"
   ```

1. Run `terraform output` to get the ID of your Cloud Build project:

   ```bash
   export cloudbuild_project_id=$(terraform output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo "cloud build project ID = ${cloudbuild_project_id}"
   ```

1. Copy the backend and update `backend.tf` with the name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket for Terraform's state. Also update the `backend.tf` of all steps.

   ```bash
   export backend_bucket=$(terraform output -raw gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "backend_bucket = ${backend_bucket}"

   export backend_bucket_projects=$(terraform output -raw projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "backend_bucket_projects = ${backend_bucket_projects}"

   cp backend.tf.example backend.tf
   cd ..

   for i in `find . -name 'backend.tf'`; do sed -i'' -e "s/UPDATE_ME/${backend_bucket}/" $i; done
   for i in `find . -name 'backend.tf'`; do sed -i'' -e "s/UPDATE_PROJECTS_BACKEND/${backend_bucket_projects}/" $i; done

   cd 0-bootstrap
   ```

1. Re-run `terraform init`. When you're prompted, agree to copy Terraform state to Cloud Storage.

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

1. (Optional) Run `terraform plan` to verify that state is configured correctly. You should see no changes from the previous state.
1. Clone the policy repo and copy contents of policy-library to new repo. Clone the repo at the same level of the `terraform-example-foundation` folder.

   ```bash
   cd ../..

   gcloud source repos clone gcp-policies --project=${cloudbuild_project_id}

   cd gcp-policies
   git checkout -b main
   cp -RT ../terraform-example-foundation/policy-library/ .
   ```

1. Commit changes and push your main branch to the policy repo.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initialize policy library repo'
   git push --set-upstream origin main
   ```

1. Navigate out of the repo.

   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

1. Save `0-bootstrap` Terraform configuration to `gcp-bootstrap` source repository:

   ```bash
   gcloud source repos clone gcp-bootstrap --project=${cloudbuild_project_id}

   cd gcp-bootstrap
   git checkout -b plan
   mkdir -p envs/shared

   cp -RT ../terraform-example-foundation/0-bootstrap/ ./envs/shared
   cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/cloudbuild-tf-* .
   cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/tf-wrapper.sh .
   chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh

   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initialize bootstrap repo'
   git push --set-upstream origin plan
   ```

1. Continue with the instructions in the [1-org](../1-org/README.md) step.

**Note 1:** The stages after `0-bootstrap` use `terraform_remote_state` data source to read common configuration like the organization ID from the output of the `0-bootstrap` stage. They will [fail](../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#error-unsupported-attribute) if the state is not copied to the Cloud Storage bucket.

**Note 2:** After the deploy, even if you did not receive the project quota error described in the [Troubleshooting guide](../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#project-quota-exceeded), we recommend that you request 50 additional projects for the **projects step service account** created in this step.

## Running Terraform locally

The following steps will guide you through deploying without using Cloud Build.

1. Clone [terraform-example-foundation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation) into your local environment and create to the `gcp-bootstrap` folder at the same level. Copy the `0-bootstrap` content and `.gitignore` to `gcp-bootstrap`.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation.git

   mkdir gcp-bootstrap

   cp -R terraform-example-foundation/0-bootstrap/* gcp-bootstrap/

   cp terraform-example-foundation/.gitignore gcp-bootstrap
   ```

1. Navigate to `gcp-bootstrap` and initialize a local Git repository to manage versions locally. Then, Create the environment branches.

   ```bash
   cd gcp-bootstrap

   git init
   git commit -m "initialize empty directory" --allow-empty
   git checkout -b plan

   git checkout -b shared
   ```

1. Rename `terraform.example.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars` and update the file with values from your environment:

   ```bash
   mv terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars
   ```

1. Rename `cb.tf` to `cb.tf.example`:

   ```bash
   mv cb.tf cb.tf.example
   ```

1. Comment Cloud Build related outputs at `outputs.tf`.

1. In `sa.tf` file, comment out lines related to Cloud Build. Specifically, search for `cicd_project_iam_member` and comment out the corresponding module, as well as the "depends_on" meta-argument in any modules that depend on the commented module.

1. In `sa.tf` file, search for `local.cicd_project_id` and comment out the corresponding code.

1. Use the helper script [validate-requirements.sh](../scripts/validate-requirements.sh) to validate your environment:

   ```bash
   ../terraform-example-foundation/scripts/validate-requirements.sh -o <ORGANIZATION_ID> -b <BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID> -u <END_USER_EMAIL>
   ```

   **Note:** The script is not able to validate if the user is in a Cloud Identity or Google Workspace group with the required roles.

1. Run `terraform init` and `terraform plan` and review the output.

   ```bash
   git checkout plan
   terraform init
   terraform plan -input=false -out bootstrap.tfplan
   ```

1. Create a new folder called gcp-policies at the same directory level as the `terraform-example-foundation` folder. Initialize a Git repository, create a branch called `main`, and copy the contents of the `policy-library` directory from the `terraform-example-foundation` folder into the gcp-policies folder.

   ```bash
   cd ../

   mkdir gcp-policies

   cd gcp-policies
   git init
   git checkout -b main
   cp -RT ../terraform-example-foundation/policy-library/ .
   ```

1. Commit changes to the main branch of the policy repo. This way you can manage versions locally.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initialize policy library repo'
   ```

1. Navigate back to `gcp-bootstrap` repo.

   ```bash
   cd ../gcp-bootstrap
   ```

1. To  validate your policies, run `gcloud beta terraform vet`. For installation instructions, see [Install Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation/validate-policies#install).

1. Run the following commands and check for violations:

   ```bash
   export VET_PROJECT_ID=A-VALID-PROJECT-ID
   terraform show -json bootstrap.tfplan > bootstrap.json
   gcloud beta terraform vet bootstrap.json --policy-library="$(pwd)/../gcp-policies" --project ${VET_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   *`A-VALID-PROJECT-ID`* must be an existing project you have access to. This is necessary because `gcloud beta terraform vet` needs to link resources to a valid Google Cloud Platform project.

1. Commit validated code in plan branch.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial version os gcp-bootstrap."
   ```

1. Checkout `shared` branch and merge the `plan` branch into it. Then, Run `terraform apply`.

   ```bash
   git checkout shared
   git merge plan

   terraform apply bootstrap.tfplan
   ```

1. Run `terraform output` to get the email address of the terraform service accounts that will be used to run steps manually and the state bucket that will be used by step `4-projects`.

   ```bash
   export network_step_sa=$(terraform output -raw networks_step_terraform_service_account_email)
   export projects_step_sa=$(terraform output -raw projects_step_terraform_service_account_email)
   export projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate=$(terraform output -raw projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate)

   echo "network step service account = ${network_step_sa}"
   echo "projects step service account = ${projects_step_sa}"
   echo "projects gcs bucket tfstate = ${projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate}"
   ```

1. Copy the backend and update `backend.tf` with the name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket for Terraform's state. Also update the `backend.tf` of all steps.

   ```bash
   export backend_bucket=$(terraform output -raw gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "backend_bucket = ${backend_bucket}"

   export backend_bucket_projects=$(terraform output -raw projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "backend_bucket_projects = ${backend_bucket_projects}"

   cp backend.tf.example backend.tf

   cd ../

   for i in `find . -name 'backend.tf'`; do sed -i'' -e "s/UPDATE_ME/${backend_bucket}/" $i; done
   for i in `find . -name 'backend.tf'`; do sed -i'' -e "s/UPDATE_PROJECTS_BACKEND/${backend_bucket_projects}/" $i; done

   cd gcp-bootstrap
   ```

1. Re-run `terraform init`. When you're prompted, agree to copy Terraform state to Cloud Storage.

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

1. Commit the new code version, so you can manage versions locally.

   ```sh
   git add backend.tf
   git commit -m "Init gcs backend."
   cd ../
   ```
