# Centralized Logging Module

This module handles logging configuration enabling one or more resources such as organization, folders, or projects to send logs to multiple destinations: [GCS bucket](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/using_exported_logs#gcs-overview), [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/using_exported_logs#pubsub-overview), and [Log Buckets](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/overview#buckets) with [Log Analytics](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/log-analytics#analytics).

## Usage

Before using this module, get familiar with the [log-export](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/log-export/google/latest) module that is the base for it.

The following example exports audit logs from two folders to the same storage destination:

```hcl
module "logs_export" {
  source = "terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation/google//1-org/modules/centralized-logging"

  resources = {
    fldr1 = "<folder1_id>"
    fldr2 = "<folder2_id>"
  }
  resource_type                  = "folder"
  logging_destination_project_id = "<log_destination_project_id>"

  storage_options = {
    logging_sink_filter = ""
    logging_sink_name   = "sk-c-logging-bkt"
    storage_bucket_name = "bkt-logs"
    location            = "us-central1"
  }
}
```

**Note:** When the destination is a Log Bucket and a sink is been created in the same project, set variable `logging_project_key` with the **key** used to map the Log Bucket project in the `resources` map.
Get more details at [Configure and manage sinks](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2#dest-auth:~:text=If%20you%27re%20using%20a%20sink%20to%20route%20logs%20between%20Logging%20buckets%20in%20the%20same%20Cloud%20project%2C%20no%20new%20service%20account%20is%20created%3B%20the%20sink%20works%20without%20the%20unique%20writer%20identity.).

The following example exports all logs from three projects - including the logging destination project - to a Log Bucket destination. As it exports all logs be aware of additional charges for this amount of logs:

```hcl
module "logging_logbucket" {
  source = "terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation/google//1-org/modules/centralized-logging"

  resources = {
    prj1 = "<log_destination_project_id>"
    prj2 = "<prj2_id>"
    prjx = "<prjx_id>"
  }
  resource_type                  = "project"
  logging_destination_project_id = "<log_destination_project_id>"
  logging_project_key            = "prj1"

  logbucket_options = {
    logging_sink_name   = "sk-c-logging-logbkt"
    logging_sink_filter = ""
    name                = "logbkt-logs"
  }
}
```
