## Purpose

The purpose of this step is to deploy a simple [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) instance in one of the business unit projects using the infra pipeline set up in 4-projects.
The infra pipeline is created in step `4-projects` within the shared env and has a [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs) pipeline configured to manage infrastructure within projects.

There is also a [Source Repository](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories) configured with build triggers similar to the [CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation#0-bootstrap) setup in `0-bootstrap`.
This Compute Engine instance is created using the base network from step `3-networks` and is used to access private services.

## Prerequisites

1. 0-bootstrap executed successfully.
1. 1-org executed successfully.
1. 2-environments executed successfully.
1. 3-networks executed successfully.
1. 4-projects executed successfully.

### Troubleshooting

Please refer to [troubleshooting](../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if you run into issues during this step.

## Usage

**Note:** If you are using MacOS, replace `cp -RT` with `cp -R` in the relevant
commands. The `-T` flag is needed for Linux, but causes problems for MacOS.

### Deploying with Cloud Build

1. Clone the `gcp-policies` repo based on the Terraform output from the `0-bootstrap` step.
Clone the repo at the same level of the `terraform-example-foundation` folder, the following instructions assume this layout.
Run `terraform output cloudbuild_project_id` in the `0-bootstrap` folder to get the Cloud Build Project ID.

   ```bash
   export INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="gcp-projects/business_unit_1/shared/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}

   gcloud source repos clone gcp-policies gcp-policies-app-infra --project=${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   **Note:** `gcp-policies` repo has the same name as the repo created in step `1-org`. In order to prevent a collision, the previous command will clone this repo in the folder `gcp-policies-app-infra`.

1. Navigate into the repo and copy contents of policy-library to new repo. All subsequent steps assume you are running them
   from the gcp-policies-app-infra directory. If you run them from another directory,
   adjust your copy paths accordingly.

   ```bash
   cd gcp-policies-app-infra
   git checkout -b main

   cp -RT ../terraform-example-foundation/policy-library/ .
   ```

1. Commit changes and push your main branch to the new repo.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initialize policy library repo'

   git push --set-upstream origin main
   ```

1. Navigate out of the repo.

   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

1. Clone the `bu1-example-app` repo.

   ```bash
   gcloud source repos clone bu1-example-app --project=${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Navigate into the repo, change to non-main branch and copy contents of foundation to new repo.
   All subsequent steps assume you are running them from the bu1-example-app directory.
   If you run them from another directory, adjust your copy paths accordingly.

   ```bash
   cd bu1-example-app
   git checkout -b plan

   cp -RT ../terraform-example-foundation/5-app-infra/ .
   cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/cloudbuild-tf-* .
   cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/tf-wrapper.sh .
   chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh
   ```

1. Rename `common.auto.example.tfvars` to `common.auto.tfvars`.

   ```bash
   mv common.auto.example.tfvars common.auto.tfvars
   ```

1. Update the file with values from your environment and 0-bootstrap. See any of the business unit 1 envs folders [README.md](./business_unit_1/production/README.md) files for additional information on the values in the `common.auto.tfvars` file.

   ```bash
   export remote_state_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-example-foundation/0-bootstrap/" output -raw projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "remote_state_bucket = ${remote_state_bucket}"
   sed -i'' -e "s/REMOTE_STATE_BUCKET/${remote_state_bucket}/" ./common.auto.tfvars
   ```

1. Commit changes.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initialize bu1 example app repo'
   ```

1. Push your plan branch to trigger a plan for all environments. Because the
   _plan_ branch is not a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch), pushing your _plan_
   branch triggers _terraform plan_ but not _terraform apply_. Review the plan output in your Cloud Build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID

   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin plan
   ```

1. Merge changes to development. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
   pushing to this branch triggers both _terraform plan_ and _terraform apply_. Review the apply output in your Cloud Build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID

   ```bash
   git checkout -b development
   git push origin development
   ```

1. Merge changes to nonproduction. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
   pushing to this branch triggers both _terraform plan_ and _terraform apply_. Review the apply output in your Cloud Build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID

   ```bash
   git checkout -b nonproduction
   git push origin nonproduction
   ```

1. Merge changes to production branch. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
      pushing to this branch triggers both _terraform plan_ and _terraform apply_. Review the apply output in your Cloud Build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID

   ```bash
   git checkout -b production
   git push origin production
   ```

### Run Terraform locally

1. The next instructions assume that you are at the same level of the `terraform-example-foundation` folder. Change into `5-app-infra` folder, copy the Terraform wrapper script and ensure it can be executed.

   ```bash
   cd terraform-example-foundation/5-app-infra
   cp ../build/tf-wrapper.sh .
   chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh
   ```

1. Rename `common.auto.example.tfvars` files to `common.auto.tfvars`.

   ```bash
   mv common.auto.example.tfvars common.auto.tfvars
   ```

1. Update `common.auto.tfvars` file with values from your environment.
1. Use `terraform output` to get the project backend bucket value from 0-bootstrap.

   ```bash
   export remote_state_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../0-bootstrap/" output -raw projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "remote_state_bucket = ${remote_state_bucket}"
   sed -i'' -e "s/REMOTE_STATE_BUCKET/${remote_state_bucket}/" ./common.auto.tfvars
   ```

1. Provide the user that will be running `./tf-wrapper.sh` the Service Account Token Creator role to the bu1 Terraform service account.
1. Provide the user permissions to run the terraform locally with the `serviceAccountTokenCreator` permission.

   ```bash
   member="user:$(gcloud auth list --filter="status=ACTIVE" --format="value(account)")"
   echo ${member}

   project_id=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/shared/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo ${project_id}

   terraform_sa=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/shared/" output -json terraform_service_accounts | jq '."bu1-example-app"' --raw-output)
   echo ${terraform_sa}

   gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding ${terraform_sa} --project ${project_id} --member="${member}" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
   ```

1. Update `backend.tf` with your bucket from the infra pipeline output.

   ```bash
   export backend_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/shared/" output -json state_buckets | jq '."bu1-example-app"' --raw-output)
   echo "backend_bucket = ${backend_bucket}"

   for i in `find . -name 'backend.tf'`; do sed -i'' -e "s/UPDATE_APP_INFRA_BUCKET/${backend_bucket}/" $i; done
   ```

We will now deploy each of our environments (development/production/nonproduction) using this script.
When using Cloud Build or Jenkins as your CI/CD tool, each environment corresponds to a branch in the repository for the `5-app-infra` step. Only the corresponding environment is applied.

To use the `validate` option of the `tf-wrapper.sh` script, please follow the [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation/validate-policies#install) to install the terraform-tools component.

1. Use `terraform output` to get the Infra Pipeline Project ID from 4-projects output.

   ```bash
   export INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/shared/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}

   export GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/shared/" output -json terraform_service_accounts | jq '."bu1-example-app"' --raw-output)
   echo ${GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
   ```

1. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment production.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init production
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan production
   ```

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate production $(pwd)/../policy-library ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` production.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply production
   ```

1. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment nonproduction.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init nonproduction
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan nonproduction
   ```

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate nonproduction $(pwd)/../policy-library ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` nonproduction.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply nonproduction
   ```

1. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment development.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init development
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan development
   ```

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate development $(pwd)/../policy-library ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` development.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply development
   ```

If you received any errors or made any changes to the Terraform config or `common.auto.tfvars` you must re-run `./tf-wrapper.sh plan <env>` before running `./tf-wrapper.sh apply <env>`.

After executing this stage, unset the `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable.

```bash
unset GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```
