# 3-networks-hub-and-spoke/shared

The purpose of this step is to set up the global [DNS Hub](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/cloud-forwarding-peering-and-zones) that will be used by all environments. This step will also create the Network Hubs that are part of the [Hub and Spoke](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations/networking#hub-and-spoke) setup.
