| base\_subnet\_secondary\_ranges | The base subnet secondary IPTs ranges to the Base Shared Vpc. | `map(list(map(string)))` | n/a | yes |
| default\_region1 | First subnet region. The shared vpc modules only configures two regions. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| default\_region2 | Second subnet region. The shared vpc modules only configures two regions. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| domain | The DNS name of peering managed zone, for instance 'example.com.'. Must end with a period. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| enable\_partner\_interconnect | Enable Partner Interconnect in the environment. | `bool` | `false` | no |
