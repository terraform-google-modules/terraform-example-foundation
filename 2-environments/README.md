## Purpose

The purpose of this step is to setup development, nonproduction, and production environments within the Google Cloud organization that you've created.

## Prerequisites

1. 0-bootstrap executed successfully.
1. 1-org executed successfully.

### Troubleshooting

Please refer to [troubleshooting](../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if you run into issues during this step.

## Assured Workloads

To enable [Assured Workloads](https://cloud.google.com/assured-workloads) in the production folder, edit the [main.tf](./envs/production/main.tf#L26) file and update `assured_workload_configuration.enable` to `true`.

See the `env_baseline` module [README.md](./modules/env_baseline/README.md) file for additional information on the values that can be configured for the Workload.

**Assured Workload is a paid service.**
FedRAMP Moderate workloads can be deployed at no additional charge to Google Cloud products and service usage.
For other compliance regimes, see [Assured Workloads pricing](https://cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/pricing).

If you enable Assured Workloads, to delete the Assured workload, you will need to manually delete the resources under it.
Use the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/compliance/assuredworkloads) to identify the resources to be deleted.

## Usage

**Note:** If you are using MacOS, replace `cp -RT` with `cp -R` in the relevant
commands. The `-T` flag is needed for Linux, but causes problems for MacOS.

### Deploying with Cloud Build

1. Clone the `gcp-environments` repo based on the Terraform output from the `0-bootstrap` step.
Clone the repo at the same level of the `terraform-example-foundation` folder, the following instructions assume this layout.
Run `terraform output cloudbuild_project_id` in the `0-bootstrap` folder to get the Cloud Build Project ID.

   ```bash
   export CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="terraform-example-foundation/0-bootstrap/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo ${CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID}

   gcloud source repos clone gcp-environments --project=${CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Navigate into the repo, change to the non-main branch and copy contents of foundation to new repo.
   All subsequent steps assume you are running them from the gcp-environments directory.
   If you run them from another directory, adjust your copy paths accordingly.

   ```bash
   cd gcp-environments
   git checkout -b plan

   cp -RT ../terraform-example-foundation/2-environments/ .
   cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/cloudbuild-tf-* .
   cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/tf-wrapper.sh .
   chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh
   ```

1. Rename `terraform.example.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars`.

   ```bash
   mv terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars
   ```

1. Update the file with values from your environment and bootstrap (you can re-run `terraform output` in the 0-bootstrap directory to find these values). See any of the envs folder [README.md](./envs/production/README.md#inputs) files for additional information on the values in the `terraform.tfvars` file.

   ```bash
   export backend_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-example-foundation/0-bootstrap/" output -raw gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "remote_state_bucket = ${backend_bucket}"

   sed -i'' -e "s/REMOTE_STATE_BUCKET/${backend_bucket}/" terraform.tfvars
   ```

1. Commit changes.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initialize environments repo'
   ```

1. Push your plan branch to trigger a plan for all environments. Because the
   _plan_ branch is not a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch), pushing your _plan_
   branch triggers _terraform plan_ but not _terraform apply_.

   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin plan
   ```

1. Review the plan output in your cloud build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID
1. Merge changes to development branch. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
   pushing to this branch triggers both _terraform plan_ and _terraform apply_.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b development
   git push origin development
   ```

1. Review the apply output in your cloud build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID
1. Merge changes to nonproduction. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
   pushing to this branch triggers both _terraform plan_ and _terraform apply_. Review the apply output in your cloud build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID

   ```bash
   git checkout -b nonproduction
   git push origin nonproduction
   ```

1. Merge changes to production branch. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
   pushing to this branch triggers both _terraform plan_ and _terraform apply_. Review the apply output in your cloud build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID

   ```bash
   git checkout -b production
   git push origin production
   ```

1. You can now move to the instructions in the network step. To use the [Dual Shared VPC](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations/networking#vpcsharedvpc-id7-1-shared-vpc-) network mode go to [3-networks-dual-svpc](../3-networks-dual-svpc/README.md), or go to [3-networks-hub-and-spoke](../3-networks-hub-and-spoke/README.md) to use the [Hub and Spoke](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations/networking#hub-and-spoke) network mode.

### Deploying with Jenkins

See `0-bootstrap` [README-Jenkins.md](../0-bootstrap/README-Jenkins.md#deploying-step-2-environments).

### Deploying with GitHub Actions

See `0-bootstrap` [README-GitHub.md](../0-bootstrap/README-GitHub.md#deploying-step-2-environments).

### Run Terraform locally

1. The next instructions assume that you are at the same level of the `terraform-example-foundation` folder. Create the `gcp-environments` folder, copy the Terraform wrapper script and ensure it can be executed.

   ```bash
   mkdir gcp-environments
   cp -R terraform-example-foundation/2-environments/* gcp-environments/
   cp terraform-example-foundation/build/tf-wrapper.sh gcp-environments/
   cp terraform-example-foundation/.gitignore gcp-environments/
   chmod 755 ./gcp-environments/tf-wrapper.sh
   ```

1. Navigate to `gcp-environments` and initialize a local Git repository to manage versions locally. Then, create the environment branches.

   ```bash
   cd gcp-environments
   git init
   git commit -m "initialize empty directory" --allow-empty
   git checkout -b production
   git checkout -b nonproduction
   git checkout -b development
   ```

1. Rename `terraform.example.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars`.

   ```bash
   mv terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars
   ```

1. Update the file with values from your environment and 0-bootstrap output.See any of the envs folder [README.md](./envs/production/README.md#inputs) files for additional information on the values in the `terraform.tfvars` file.
1. Use `terraform output` to get the backend bucket value from 0-bootstrap output.

   ```bash
   export backend_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-bootstrap/" output -raw gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "remote_state_bucket = ${backend_bucket}"

   sed -i'' -e "s/REMOTE_STATE_BUCKET/${backend_bucket}/" ./terraform.tfvars
   ```

We will now deploy each of our environments(development/production/nonproduction) using this script.

To use the `validate` option of the `tf-wrapper.sh` script, please follow the [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation/validate-policies#install) to install the terraform-tools component.

1. Use `terraform output` to get the Seed project ID and the organization step Terraform service account from gcp-bootstrap output. An environment variable `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` will be set using the Terraform Service Account to enable impersonation.

   ```bash
   export SEED_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-bootstrap/" output -raw seed_project_id)
   echo ${SEED_PROJECT_ID}

   export GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-bootstrap/" output -raw environment_step_terraform_service_account_email)
   echo ${GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
   ```

1. Checkout `development` branch. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment development.

   ```bash
   git checkout development
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init development
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan development
   ```

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate development $(pwd)/../gcp-policies ${SEED_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` development and commit the initial version of `development` branch.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply development
   git add .
   git commit -m "Development initial commit."
   ```

1. Checkout `nonproduction` branch and merge `development` branch into it. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment nonproduction.

   ```bash
   git checkout nonproduction
   git merge development
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init nonproduction
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan nonproduction
   ```

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate nonproduction $(pwd)/../gcp-policies ${SEED_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` production and commit initial version of nonproduction.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply nonproduction
   git add .
   git commit -m "Nonproduction initial commit."
   ```

1. Checkout `production` branch and merge `nonproduction` branch into it. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment production.

   ```bash
   git checkout production
   git merge nonproduction
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init production
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan production
   ```

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate production $(pwd)/../gcp-policies ${SEED_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` production and commit initial version of production.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply production
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production initial commit."
   ```

If you received any errors or made any changes to the Terraform config or `terraform.tfvars` you must re-run `./tf-wrapper.sh plan <env>` before running `./tf-wrapper.sh apply <env>`.

Before executing the next stages, unset the `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable.

```bash
unset GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```
