[terraform-example-foundation README](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation).

## Purpose

The purpose of this step is to:

- Set up the global [DNS Hub](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/cloud-forwarding-peering-and-zones).
- Shared VPCs with default DNS, NAT (optional), Private Service networking, VPC Service Controls (optional), on-premises Dedicated or Partner Interconnect, and baseline firewall rules for each environment.

## Prerequisites

1. 0-bootstrap executed successfully.
1. 1-org executed successfully.
1. 2-environments executed successfully.
1. For the manual step described in this document, you need to use the same [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) version used on the build pipeline.
Otherwise, you might experience Terraform state snapshot lock errors.

### Troubleshooting

Please refer to [troubleshooting](../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if you run into issues during this step.

## Usage

**Note:** If you are using MacOS, replace `cp -RT` with `cp -R` in the relevant
commands. The `-T` flag is needed for Linux, but causes problems for MacOS.

### Networking Architecture

This step makes use of the **Dual Shared VPC** architecture, and more details can be found described at the **Networking** section of the [Google cloud security foundations guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations/networking). To see the version that makes use the Hub and Spoke mode, check the step [3-networks-hub-and-spoke](../3-networks-hub-and-spoke).

### Using Dedicated Interconnect

If you provisioned the prerequisites listed in the [Dedicated Interconnect README](./modules/dedicated_interconnect/README.md), follow these steps to enable Dedicated Interconnect to access on-premises resources.

1. Rename `interconnect.tf.example` to `interconnect.tf` in the shared envs folder in `3-networks-svpc/envs/shared`
1. Update the file `interconnect.tf` with values that are valid for your environment for the interconnects, locations, candidate subnetworks, vlan_tag8021q and peer info.
1. Rename `interconnect.tf.example` to `interconnect.tf` in base_env folder in `3-networks-svpc/modules/base_env`.
1. Update the file `interconnect.tf` with values that are valid for your environment for the interconnects, locations, candidate subnetworks, vlan_tag8021q and peer info.
1. Set variable `enable_dedicated_interconnect` to `true`
1. The candidate subnetworks and vlan_tag8021q variables can be set to `null` to allow the interconnect module to auto generate these values.

### Using Partner Interconnect

If you provisioned the prerequisites listed in the [Partner Interconnect README](./modules/partner_interconnect/README.md) follow this steps to enable Partner Interconnect to access on-premises resources.

1. Rename `partner_interconnect.tf.example` to `partner_interconnect.tf` in the shared envs folder in `3-networks-svpc/envs/shared`
1. Rename `partner_interconnect.auto.tfvars.example` to `partner_interconnect.auto.tfvars` in the shared envs folder in `3-networks-svpc/envs/shared`
1. Update the file `interconnect.tf` with values that are valid for your environment for the interconnects, locations, candidate subnetworks, vlan_tag8021q and peer info.
1. Rename `partner_interconnect.tf.example` to `partner_interconnect.tf` in the base-env folder in `3-networks-svpc/modules/base_env` .
1. Update the `enable_partner_interconnect` to `true` in each `main.tf` file in the environment folder in `3-networks-svpc/envs/<environment>` .
1. Update the file `partner_interconnect.tf` with values that are valid for your environment for the VLAN attachments, locations, and candidate subnetworks.
1. The candidate subnetworks variable can be set to `null` to allow the interconnect module to auto generate this value.

### OPTIONAL - Using High Availability VPN

If you are not able to use Dedicated or Partner Interconnect, you can also use an HA Cloud VPN to access on-premises resources.

1. Rename `vpn.tf.example` to `vpn.tf` in base-env folder in `3-networks-svpc/modules/base_env`.
1. Create secret for VPN private pre-shared key and grant required roles to Networks terraform service account.

   ```bash
   echo '<YOUR-PRESHARED-KEY-SECRET>' | gcloud secrets create <VPN_PRIVATE_PSK_SECRET_NAME> --project <ENV_SECRETS_PROJECT> --replication-policy=automatic --data-file=-

   gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding <VPN_PRIVATE_PSK_SECRET_NAME> --member='serviceAccount:<NETWORKS_TERRAFORM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT>' --role='roles/secretmanager.viewer' --project <ENV_SECRETS_PROJECT>
   gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding <VPN_PRIVATE_PSK_SECRET_NAME> --member='serviceAccount:<NETWORKS_TERRAFORM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT>' --role='roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor' --project <ENV_SECRETS_PROJECT>
   ```

1. Create secret for VPN restricted pre-shared key and grant required roles to Networks terraform service account.

   ```bash
   echo '<YOUR-PRESHARED-KEY-SECRET>' | gcloud secrets create <VPN_RESTRICTED_PSK_SECRET_NAME> --project <ENV_SECRETS_PROJECT> --replication-policy=automatic --data-file=-

   gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding <VPN_RESTRICTED_PSK_SECRET_NAME> --member='serviceAccount:<NETWORKS_TERRAFORM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT>' --role='roles/secretmanager.viewer' --project <ENV_SECRETS_PROJECT>
   gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding <VPN_RESTRICTED_PSK_SECRET_NAME> --member='serviceAccount:<NETWORKS_TERRAFORM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT>' --role='roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor' --project <ENV_SECRETS_PROJECT>
   ```

1. In the file `vpn.tf`, update the values for `environment`, `vpn_psk_secret_name`, `on_prem_router_ip_address1`, `on_prem_router_ip_address2` and `bgp_peer_asn`.
1. Verify other default values are valid for your environment.

### Deploying with Cloud Build

1. Clone the `gcp-networks` repo based on the Terraform output from the `0-bootstrap` step.
Clone the repo at the same level of the `terraform-example-foundation` folder, the following instructions assume this layout.
Run `terraform output cloudbuild_project_id` in the `0-bootstrap` folder to get the Cloud Build Project ID.

   ```bash
   export CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="terraform-example-foundation/0-bootstrap/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo ${CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID}

   gcloud source repos clone gcp-networks --project=${CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Change to the freshly cloned repo, change to the non-main branch and copy contents of foundation to new repo.

   ```bash
   cd gcp-networks/
   git checkout -b plan

   cp -RT ../terraform-example-foundation/3-networks-svpc/ .
   cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/cloudbuild-tf-* .
   cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/tf-wrapper.sh .
   chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh
   ```

2. Rename `common.auto.example.tfvars` to `common.auto.tfvars`, rename `production.auto.example.tfvars` to `production.auto.tfvars`.

   ```bash
   mv common.auto.example.tfvars common.auto.tfvars
   mv production.auto.example.tfvars production.auto.tfvars
   ```

3. Update `common.auto.tfvars` file with values from your environment and bootstrap. See any of the envs folder [README.md](./envs/production/README.md) files for additional information on the values in the `common.auto.tfvars` file.
   Update `production.auto.tfvars` file with the `target_name_server_addresses`.
   Use `terraform output` to get the backend bucket value from 0-bootstrap output.

   ```bash
   export backend_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-example-foundation/0-bootstrap/" output -raw gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "remote_state_bucket = ${backend_bucket}"

   sed -i'' -e "s/REMOTE_STATE_BUCKET/${backend_bucket}/" ./common.auto.tfvars
   ```

4. Commit changes

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initialize networks repo'
   ```

5. You must manually plan and apply the `shared` environment (only once) since the `development`, `nonproduction` and `production` environments depend on it.
6. To use the `validate` option of the `tf-wrapper.sh` script, please follow the [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation/validate-policies#install) to install the terraform-tools component.
7. Use `terraform output` to get the Cloud Build project ID and the networks step Terraform Service Account from 0-bootstrap output. An environment variable `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` will be set using the Terraform Service Account to enable impersonation.

   ```bash
   export CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-example-foundation/0-bootstrap/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo ${CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID}

   export GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(terraform -chdir="../terraform-example-foundation/0-bootstrap/" output -raw networks_step_terraform_service_account_email)
   echo ${GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
   ```

8. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment shared.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init shared
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan shared
   ```

9. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate shared $(pwd)/../gcp-policies ${CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

10. Run `apply` shared.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply shared
   ```

11. You must manually plan and apply the `production` environment since the `development`, `nonproduction` and `plan` environments depend on it.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b production
   ```

12. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment production.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init production
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan production
   ```

13. Run `apply` production.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply production
   ```

14. Push your production branch since development and nonproduction depends it.  Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
pushing to this branch triggers both _terraform plan_ and _terraform apply_. Review the apply output in your Cloud Build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID

*Note:** The Production environment must be the first branch to be pushed as it includes the DNS Hub communication that will be used by other environments.

   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin production
   ```

1. Push your plan branch to trigger a plan for all environments. Because the
   _plan_ branch is not a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch), pushing your _plan_
   branch triggers _terraform plan_ but not _terraform apply_. Review the plan output in your Cloud Build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID

   ```bash
   git checkout plan
   git push --set-upstream origin plan
   ```

1. After plan has been applied, apply development.
1. Merge changes to development. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
   pushing to this branch triggers both _terraform plan_ and _terraform apply_. Review the apply output in your Cloud Build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID

   ```bash
   git checkout -b development
   git push origin development
   ```

1. After development has been applied, apply nonproduction.
1. Merge changes to nonproduction. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
   pushing to this branch triggers both _terraform plan_ and _terraform apply_. Review the apply output in your Cloud Build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=DEFAULT_REGION?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID

   ```bash
   git checkout -b nonproduction
   git push origin nonproduction
   ```

1. Before executing the next steps, unset the `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable.

   ```bash
   unset GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
   ```

1. You can now move to the instructions in the [4-projects](../4-projects/README.md) step.

### Deploying with Jenkins

See `0-bootstrap` [README-Jenkins.md](../0-bootstrap/README-Jenkins.md#deploying-step-3-networks-svpc).

### Deploying with GitHub Actions

See `0-bootstrap` [README-GitHub.md](../0-bootstrap/README-GitHub.md#deploying-step-3-networks-svpc).

### Run Terraform locally

1. The next instructions assume that you are at the same level of the `terraform-example-foundation` folder. Create and change into `gcp-network` folder, copy `3-networks-svpc` content, the Terraform wrapper script and ensure it can be executed. Also, initialize git so you can manage versions locally.

   ```bash
   mkdir gcp-network
   cp -R terraform-example-foundation/3-networks-svpc/* gcp-network
   cp terraform-example-foundation/build/tf-wrapper.sh gcp-network/
   cp terraform-example-foundation/.gitignore gcp-network/
   chmod 755 ./gcp-network/tf-wrapper.sh
   ```

1. Navigate to `gcp-network` and initialize a local Git repository to manage versions locally. Then, create the environment branches.

   ```bash
   cd gcp-network
   git init
   git commit -m "initialize empty directory" --allow-empty
   git checkout -b shared
   git checkout -b production
   git checkout -b development
   git checkout -b nonproduction
   ```

1. The next instructions assume that you are at the same level of the `terraform-example-foundation` folder. Change into `3-networks-svpc` folder, copy the Terraform wrapper script and ensure it can be executed.

   ```bash
   cd terraform-example-foundation/3-networks-svpc
   cp ../build/tf-wrapper.sh .
   chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh
   ```

1. Rename `common.auto.example.tfvars` to `common.auto.tfvars`, rename `production.auto.example.tfvars` to `production.auto.tfvars`.

   ```bash
   mv common.auto.example.tfvars common.auto.tfvars
   mv production.auto.example.tfvars production.auto.tfvars
   ```

1. Update `common.auto.tfvars` file with values from your environment and bootstrap. See any of the envs folder [README.md](./envs/production/README.md) files for additional information on the values in the `common.auto.tfvars` file.
1. Update `production.auto.tfvars` file with the `target_name_server_addresses`.
2. Use `terraform output` to get the backend bucket value from gcp-bootstrap output.

   ```bash
   export backend_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-bootstrap/envs/shared/" output -raw gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "remote_state_bucket = ${backend_bucket}"

   sed -i'' -e "s/REMOTE_STATE_BUCKET/${backend_bucket}/" ./common.auto.tfvars
   ````

We will now deploy each of our environments(development/production/nonproduction) using this script.
When using Cloud Build or Jenkins as your CI/CD tool each environment corresponds to a branch in the repository for 3-networks-svpc step
and only the corresponding environment is applied.

To use the `validate` option of the `tf-wrapper.sh` script, please follow the [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation/validate-policies#install) to install the terraform-tools component.

1. Use `terraform output` to get the Seed project ID and the organization step Terraform service account from 0-bootstrap output. An environment variable `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` will be set using the Terraform Service Account to enable impersonation.

   ```bash
   export SEED_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-bootstrap/envs/shared/" output -raw seed_project_id)
   echo ${SEED_PROJECT_ID}

   export GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(terraform -chdir="../gcp-bootstrap/envs/shared/" output -raw networks_step_terraform_service_account_email)
   echo ${GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
   ```

1. Checkout `shared` branch. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment shared.

   ```bash
   git checkout shared
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init shared
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan shared
   ```

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate shared $(pwd)/../gcp-policies ${SEED_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` shared.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply shared
   ```

1. Checkout shared `production`. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment production.

   ```bash
   git checkout production
   git merge shared
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init production
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan production
   ```

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate production $(pwd)/../gcp-policies ${SEED_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` production.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply production
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial production commit."
   cd ../
   ```

1. Run `git commit` shared.

   ```bash
   git checkout shared
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial shared commit."
   ```

1. Checkout `development` branch and merge `shared` into it. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment production.

   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git merge shared
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init development
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan development
   ```

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate development $(pwd)/../gcp-policies ${SEED_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` development.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply development
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial development commit."
   ```

1. Checkout `nonproduction` and merge `development` into it. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment nonproduction.

   ```bash
   git checkout nonproduction
   git merge development
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init nonproduction
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan nonproduction
   ```

1. Run `validate` and check for violations.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate nonproduction $(pwd)/../gcp-policies ${SEED_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

1. Run `apply` nonproduction.

   ```bash
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply nonproduction
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial nonproduction commit."
   ```

If you received any errors or made any changes to the Terraform config or any `.tfvars`, you must re-run `./tf-wrapper.sh plan <env>` before run `./tf-wrapper.sh apply <env>`.

Before executing the next stages, unset the `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable.

```bash
unset GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```
