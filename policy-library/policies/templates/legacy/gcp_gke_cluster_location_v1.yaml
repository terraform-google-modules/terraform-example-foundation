                can be created, e.g. us-central1-a, us-east1. Multiple locations can
                be specified. Regions and zones need to be specified separately, as
                this allows for restricting clusters to be zonal or regional, e.g.
                whitelisting us-central1 will allow regional clusters to be created,
                but will not implicitly allow zonal clusters in any us-central1 zone."
