# 3-networks-dual-svpc/production

The purpose of this step is to set up base and restricted shared VPCs with default DNS, NAT (optional), Private Service networking, VPC service controls, onprem Dedicated Interconnect, onprem VPN and baseline firewall rules for environment production and the global [DNS Hub](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/cloud-forwarding-peering-and-zones) that will be used by all environments.
